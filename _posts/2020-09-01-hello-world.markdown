This is the first time for me to create my homepage at Github, with [**jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Well, I am not willing to end the first post with a single line, so let me begin with "Hello World"!

{% highlight python %}
def print_hello(name):
  print("Hello" + name)
print_hello("World!")
#=> prints 'Hello World!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
